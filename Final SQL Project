-- In this final project I was given a database that represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. I was tasked with answering the following questions through queries.
--The database contained tables titled as albums, artists, customers, employees, genres, invoice_items, invoices, media_types, playlist_track, playlists, tracks.

--#1 Show Cus;tomers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

--#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM Chinook.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN Chinook.invoices AS inv
ON cust.customerID = inv.CustomerID
WHERE cust.Country = 'Brazil';

--#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM Chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT BillingCountry ) 
FROM Chinook.invoices;

--#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, emp.EmployeeId, emp.Title,
cust.CustomerId, cust.SupportRepID,
inv.InvoiceId, inv.CustomerId
FROM Chinook.employees as emp
LEFT JOIN Chinook.customers as cust
ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepID
INNER JOIN Chinook.invoices as inv
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
ORDER BY emp.LastName DESC;

--#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.Total,
cust.FirstName AS CustFirstName, cust.LastName AS CustLastName, cust.Country,
emp.LastName AS EmpLastName, emp.FirstName AS EmpFirstName
FROM Chinook.invoices as inv
INNER JOIN Chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN Chinook.employees as emp
ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepID
ORDER BY cust.LastName DESC;

--#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceID), InvoiceDate
FROM Chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--#9 What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) AS Total_Sales_2009
FROM Chinook.invoices
WHERE invoiceDate like '%2009%';

--#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT track.Name, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.tracks AS track
INNER JOIN Chinook.invoice_items AS items
ON track.TrackId=items.TrackId
INNER JOIN Chinook.invoices as inv
ON items.InvoiceId=inv.InvoiceId
ORDER BY inv.InvoiceId DESC;

--#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT track.Name AS Track_Name, artist.Name AS Artist_Name, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM Chinook.tracks AS track
INNER JOIN Chinook.albums AS album
ON track.AlbumId=album.AlbumId
INNER JOIN Chinook.artists AS artist
ON album.ArtistId=artist.ArtistId
LEFT JOIN Chinook.invoice_items AS invoices
ON track.TrackId=invoices.TrackId
ORDER BY invoices.InvoiceId DESC;

--#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT track.Name AS Track_Name, alb.Title AS Album, media.Name as Media_Tyep, genre.Name AS Genre
FROM tracks AS track
INNER JOIN albums AS alb
ON track.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId
INNER JOIN media_types AS media
ON track.MediaTypeId=media.MediaTypeId
INNER JOIN genres AS genre
ON track.GenreId=genre.GenreId
ORDER BY track.Name DESC; 

--#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

--#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
